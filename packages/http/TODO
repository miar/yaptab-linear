---+ HTTP Server library todo list

---++ Session handling

Especially now that we store the current request  as a record in the CGI
stream, it is now much too expensive to get the current session.  How to
deal with that?	 Also store in the CGI object?

---++ Debugging

We plan to provide a in-core  store   for  requests with predicates that
control what requests are stored. This   allows for showing the requests
as well as replaying requests from the user-thread for easy debugging.

Can we deal with HTTP POST requests?

---++ JSON integration

JavaScript Simple Object Notation is a   simple and lightweight exchange
protocol for structured data. Support for   it  is progressing, with the
following items on our todo list.

	* Hook json_convert.pl into json.pl
	* Deal with nested objects in conversion
	* Documentation.
