[Sep 9 2009]

 * ADDED: uri_file_name/2

 * ADDED: library(uri), providing a much faster and modern API to handling
   URIs and IRIs.

[Aug 18 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Bug#413: Complete 'make distclean'.  Feliks Kluzniak
[Aug 7 2009]

 * MODIFIED: WinSock interface now signals WSAECONNABORTED as EOF when reading. This is somewhat debatable, but compatible with the Unix version of the socket interface.  Matt Lilley.

[Aug 3 2009]

 * PORT: Avoid name-clash on SOCK_* constants.
[Jul 27 2009]

 * FIXED: Another timer issue that could crash the alarm-scheduler.

 * FIXED: The library(time) now uses SIGUSR2 rather then SIGALRM if available to avoid interference from libreadline's signal handling of SIGALRM.

 * FIXED: Crash in alarm-timers (Multi-threaded unix version)

[Jul 21 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Make initialization/1 ISO compliant
   This patch is a modest cleanup to the implementation of '$load_file'/3
   from init.pl and provides an ISO compatible implementation of
   initialization/1. This executes the argument goal *after* loading the
   file rather than when encountering the directive. Often this makes no
   difference, but notably load_foreign_library/1 is an exception.
   Therefore we added use_foreign_library/1,2 that act as a directive and
   provides proper integration with saved-states automatically.  Loading
   code using initialization(load_foreign_library(...)) will load the
   library immediately and issue a warning.

   See initialization/1,2 for details and further hints for dealing with
   possible compatibility problems.

[Jul 8 2009]

 * ADDED: alarm_at/4.  Addition provided by Samar Abdallah.

[Jul 6 2009]

[Mar 19 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.
[Mar 12 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.

[Feb 4 2009]

 * FIXED: Uninitialised variable in environment parsing of process.c.  Keri Harris.

[Jan 29 2009]

 * CLEANUP: generalisations in the socket library design to allow TIPC to
   reuse parts of it.  Contributed by Jeff Rosenwald.

 * PORT: Port new environment initialisation of process_create/3 to Windows.
   The new environment processing code is free of limits (of course, except
   limits of the operating system).

[Jan 28 2009]

 * ADDED: env option to process_create/3 to specify the environment for
   the child process.

[Jan 26 2009]

 * FIXED: make install_alarm/1 produce an error when installing twice.

 * ADDED: library(streaminfo) for debugging (network) stream issues
[Jan 23 2009]

 * CHECK: Fixed makefile for modified test entry-point

[Jan 22 2009]

 * ADDED: free_on_close option to open_memory_file/4

 * CLEANUP: library(time) to use meta_predicate declaration and make debugging a
   bit simpler.
[Oct 9 2008]

 * ADDED: library(unix): support symbolic signal names.

 * FIXED: Many errors in exceptions raised after failing system calls
   by the libraries from the clib package.

[Oct 2 2008]

 * ENHANCED: Cache value of gethostname/1.
[Sep 11 2008]

 * PORT: Add AC_PREREQ to configure.h for systems that auto-select autoconf
   versions.  After tip by Ulrich Neumerkel.

[Sep 9 2008]

 * ADDED: TCP sockets: support TCP_NODELAY using tcp_setopt(Socket, nodelay(true)).
   After patch submitted by Matt Lilley.

[Aug 14 2008]

 * FIXED: Possible crash if closing a socket in Windows fails.  Matt Lilley.

[Aug 13 2008]

[Aug 11 2008]

 * INSTALL: Remove all configure files from the git repository
[Jul 4 2008]

 * FIXED: library(process) stream administration (could lead to errors in close)

[Jul 3 2008]

 * ADDED: memory_file_to_atom/3 and memory_file_to_codes/3 to convert encodings.

[Jun 27 2008]

 * FIXED: read_line_to_codes/3: foreign implementation did not unlock stream.
[Jun 13 2008]

 * FIXED: Include initialization to load process.so.  Matt Lilley.

[May 21 2008]

 * FIXED: Error message when using a service name in tcp_bind/connect.
   Jean-Marc Vanel.

[May 20 2008]

 * PORT: Port UDP socket support to Windows

 * MODIFIED: Streams in socket.pl and ssl.pl appeared unbuffered.  They
   are now fully buffered.

[May 19 2008]

 * ADDED: support for 'as(Type) option to udp_receive/4

[May 16 2008]

 * FIXED: Process streams are by default in text-mode using full buffering.

[May 12 2008]

 * PORT: Ported library(process) to Windows

[May 11 2008]

 * ADDED: library(process), providing SICStus 4 compatible process interaction
   to the clib packages.  Currently runs on Unix systems only (tested Linux and
   MacOS X 10.4).

   This patch also extends the foreign interface with the PL_get_signum_ex()
   and PL_cleanup_fork().

[Mar 10 2008]

 * FIXED: Pass error while waiting for accept() in Windows

[Feb 26 2008]

    output argument.  Keri Harris.

Jul 12, 2007

  * FIXED: call_with_time_limit/2 if the alarm fires before call_cleanup
    is entered, a theoretical problem using short timeouts on a loaded
    machine.

  * ADDED: install_alarm/1.

  * FIXED: Avoid exit of Prolog on uncaught exception from
    call_with_time_limit/2.  Ulrich Neumerkel.

    to Mike Elston for providing the test program.
