%%	stream_info(+Stream) is det.
%
%	Print detailed information about a stream   or  a file-number to
%	the error output. The  output  of   this  command  is  meant for
%	experts and requires  knowledge  about   the  implementation  of
%	streams. It has been  added  to   diagnose  leaking  streams  in
%	web-servers. For example,  on  linux   systems  we  can  examine
%	process file-descriptors using
%
%	==
%	% ls -l /proc/<pid>/fd
%	==
%
%	If now (say) descriptor 15 is open   where  it should not be, we
%	can this command to find the associated Prolog streams and print
%	as mush as possible information about the stream.
