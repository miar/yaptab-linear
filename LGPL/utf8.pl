%
%	DCG translating between  a  Unicode   code-list  and  its  UTF-8
%	encoded  byte-string.  The  DCG  works   two  ways.  Encoding  a
%	code-list to a UTF-8 byte string is achieved using
%
%		phrase(utf8_codes(Codes), UTF8)
%
%	The  algorithm  is  a  close  copy    of  the  C-algorithm  used
%	internally and defined in src/pl-utf8.c
%
%	NOTE: in many  cases  you  can   avoid  this  library  and leave
%	encoding and decoding to I/O streams. If   only part of the data
%	is to be encoded the  encoding  of   a  stream  can  be switched
%	temporary using set_stream(Stream, encoding(utf8))
